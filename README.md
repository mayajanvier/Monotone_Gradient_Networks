# Monotone_Gradient_Networks
Implementation of [Learning Gradients of Convex Functions with Monotone Gradient Networks (Chaudhari et al. (2023))](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10862)

## Installation
- Clone [CP-Flow](https://github.com/CW-Huang/CP-Flow) to be able to run the corresponding experiment in the notebook 
- Move `models.py` and `train_ot_coupling` into the main folder of `CP-Flow'
- You can now run the the corresponding cell in the notebook (part 3.c)
