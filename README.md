# Monotone_Gradient_Networks
Maya Janvier and Margot Boyer  

Implementation of [Learning Gradients of Convex Functions with Monotone Gradient Networks (Chaudhari et al. (2023))](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10862)

## Setup for 3.c part of the notebook
- Clone [CP-Flow](https://github.com/CW-Huang/CP-Flow) to be able to run the corresponding experiment in the notebook 
- Move `models.py` and `train_ot_coupling.py` into the main folder of `CP-Flow'
- You can now run the the corresponding cell in the notebook (part 3.c)
